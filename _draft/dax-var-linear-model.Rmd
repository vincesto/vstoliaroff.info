title: "Compute DAX VaR with linear Model"
output: github_document

It should be the occasion to review the use of 
- xlsx Package
- dplyr Package
- linear model for VaR
- a bit of ggplot2 utilities for plotting and backtesting of the VaR


## Get your Data

The composition of the Index, as well as the closing price of its constituents is published daily by the Deutsche BÃ¶rse
The url is simple to resolve: 
`http://www.dax-indices.com/MediaLibrary/Document/WeightingFiles/09/DAX_ICR.20160930.xls`

A basic loop on dates and the use of `xlsx` package to extract the relevant information are used to save the Price and Weights 

```{r}
as.character(seq(as.Date("2009/12/01"),as.Date("2016/09/30"),by="day"))
library("gdata")
data  <- read.xls(xls="http://www.dax-indices.com/MediaLibrary/Document/WeightingFiles/09/DAX_ICR.20160930.xls",
                  sheet=2,
                  header=TRUE,
                  skip=2)

data  <- read.xls(xls="http://www.dax-indices.com/MediaLibrary/Document/WeightingFiles/09/DAX_ICR.20161001.xls",
                  sheet=2,
                  header=TRUE,
                  skip=2)
                  
head(data)


```

In a final step, we aggregate every dataset in one data frame
