## Question of the day  
The shell `tree` command produces nice indented listing of files and directories. As an illustration, let's check the content of the `rmarkdown` package directory on my machine. Calling `tree` with the option to display 2 sub-levels of directories only would result in the following output:

```{bash}
tree ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3/rmarkdown -L 2
``` 

It would be nice to display the same kind of output for any tree-based hierarchy (not only directories). I am thinking of ontologies for example. 
The question has already been touched on [stackoverflow](<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19699059/representing-directory-file-structure-in-markdown-syntax>) for markdown documents so here I would like to adress the issue with Rmarkdown syntax and R utilities specifically.  

## The data.tree solution
